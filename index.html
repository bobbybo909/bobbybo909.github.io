                <p> Throughout his first day as America’s top overseas ambassador, Mr. Trump posed for pictures, shook hands with his hosts and avoided his domestic turmoil. The president’s aides scheduled the trip with no news conferences and few opportunities for reporters to ask the president questions.</p>

                <p> Mr. Trump’s royal hosts, whose country was not among those whose citizens would be barred, have chosen to ignore that history in the interests of working with an American president who seems to share their goals and will not lecture them about repression of women or others in Saudi Arabia.</p>
